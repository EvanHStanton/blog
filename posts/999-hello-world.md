# Hello world,

and what a beautiful time it is to be alive! And while I'm certainly not the first to say it, nor will I be the last, allow me to share with excitement that we're active participants in the age of data, perhaps even golden age. Think about it: the amount of freely available information is apparently infinite and trending towards higher and higher accessbility. 

It's absolutely bonkers to be witnessing paradigm shifts unfold before our very eyes; seeing members of the community bootstrap their way to success, even more excitingly, without the need of a traditional academic degree.

Being something of a scientist myself, I've found that one of the most important (and transferable) skillsets is the pursuit of reliable sources of information. In this post, I hope I can share some of the resources I've found useful, and perhaps offer a sprinkle of value along the way. This list will evolve continuously.

> At the end of the day, make the decision that's right for you based on your trusted sources.
