# Initial thoughts

**57 RSVP -- 30 actual attendees (52.6%, not bad at all!)**

Going into this event, I tried to be conscious about finding the balance with a few points:
- keeping this a low-key meetup versus a more professional event;
- socializing and networking versus hosting and administration. 

Looking back, I feel as though a nice harmony was found, though I include my thoughts on improvement within the [closing thoughts](#closing-thoughts).

With regards to the speakers, I personally loved that we experienced two sides of a spectrum; on one side we learned about Postgres internals, while on the other side, more of an ecosystem-wide conversation.

The audience was very engaged, and comprised a mixture of professionals and those much newer to Postgres. 

> I really feel that success in life can be distilled down to one word: exposure.

# Aychin Gasimov

- Talk title: What's new in PostgreSQL 17
- Speaker affiliation: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), Senior Partner Solutions Architect
- [Slides for this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10i6NWnRN5bCWclmUw4kUowYtuy6Z6ccu/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p1)

Aychin gave a nice overview of the new features in the major release 17 of Postgres. I personally found some of the points on event triggers to be surprising. Specifically, as I understand it, that [login event triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/event-trigger-database-login-example.html) didn't exist prior to this major release! Here are the [official release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html) if you're interested in learning more.

# Peter Farkas

- Talk title: FerretDB 2.0, and a step towards a new open standard for Document Databases
- Speaker affiliation: [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.com/), CEO
- Slides TBD

Peter closed the evening with a nice history of SQL and the founding of FerretDB. Their central thesis, as I understand it, is that Postgres (free and open source) can be just as performant in document-oriented operations as proprietary options. From there, he transitioned into the exciting release of FerretDB 2.0, which I found particularly interesting, as I was hands-on with v1.
