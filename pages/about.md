# About

Hi there, and welcome to my humble nook!

My name is Evan and I'm a neuroscientist-turned software engineer.
To this point, I feel a significant portion of my focus has been dedicated towards gathering information, finding patterns, and trying to make a positive impact whenever possible.

Part of my motivation for maintaining this space is based off of two philosophies:
    1. For every person, there is a balance to be found between consuming and producing informative material.
    2. One of the words that life success can be distilled down to is "exposure".

I view this as my personal corner of the internet where I share interests, protocols, and more!
Right now there's no set frequency of posting, no standard of editing, etc.
That said, if someone gains a sprinkle of value/inspiration/curiosity, then I'd be very happy.

Thanks for stopping by.


Best Regards,
Evan
