      <h1>PostgreSQL Munich Meetup January 2025</h1>

      <p>This was our first, inagural event, and what a success it was! Up front, we would like to extend our appreciation to Amazon Web Services (AWS), who generously hosted and sponsored this event!</p>
<p>It’s also important to extend a special thanks to the individuals who helped make this event possible:</p>

<h1 id="initial-thoughts">Initial thoughts</h1>
<p><strong>57 RSVP – 30 actual attendees (52.6%, not bad at all!)</strong></p>
<p>Going into this event, I tried to be conscious about finding the balance with a few points: - keeping this a low-key meetup versus a more professional event; - socializing and networking versus hosting and administration.</p>
<p>Looking back, I feel as though a nice harmony was found, though I include my thoughts on improvement within the <a href="#closing-thoughts">closing thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>With regards to the speakers, I personally loved that we experienced two sides of a spectrum; on one side we learned about Postgres internals, while on the other side, more of an ecosystem-wide conversation.</p>
<p>The audience was very engaged, and comprised a mixture of professionals and those much newer to Postgres.</p>

<p>I really feel that success in life can be distilled down to one word: exposure.</p>

</ul>
<p>Aychin gave a nice overview of the new features in the major release 17 of Postgres. I personally found some of the points on event triggers to be surprising. Specifically, as I understand it, that <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/event-trigger-database-login-example.html">login event triggers</a> didn’t exist prior to this major release! Here are the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html">official release notes</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>

</ul>
<p>Peter closed the evening with a nice history of SQL and the founding of FerretDB. Their central thesis, as I understand it, is that Postgres (free and open source) can be just as performant in document-oriented operations as proprietary options. From there, he transitioned into the exciting release of FerretDB 2.0, which I found particularly interesting, as I was hands-on with v1.</p>
